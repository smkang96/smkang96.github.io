I am a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST researching software engineering: specifically, I use machine learning to build tools to help developers find and remove bugs from software. My research focuses on facilitating the debugging process from the perspective of the developer. For example, I have contributed towards [automatically reproducing bug reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11515) and [explainable automated debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02195). I have also contributed to the theory of the field by analyzing existing techniques using a novel [Bayesian statistics framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13773).

Currently, I am employed by [Dr. Shin Yoo](https://coinse.github.io/members/shin.yoo/) in the [COINSE](https://coinse.github.io) research group at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://kaist.ac.kr).
