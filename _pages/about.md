Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher at NUS researching software engineering.

Currently, I am employed by [Prof. Abhik Roychoudhury](https://abhikrc.com/) in the [TSS](https://nus-tss.github.io/) research group at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), where I am doing research on combining LLM agents with traditional software analysis techniques to help explain debugging results and provide evidence for predictions. My Ph.D. was advised by [Prof. Shin Yoo](https://coinse.github.io/members/shin.yoo/) on the topic of how to enhance trust in LLMs via the execution of software.
