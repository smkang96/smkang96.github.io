While Ph.D. students usually don't teach students in Korea,
I've was able to substitute for my PI while he was away for
unexpected and unavoidable reasons.

Specifically, I've given substitute lectures (in English) on:

 * Testing for deep neural networks
 * Intellectual Property
 * Anonymity and Security on Computing

I've also participated as a teaching assistant in multiple courses, and
received an Excellent Teaching Assistant Award as a result. As a result of my
experience as a TA, I have experience with designing assignments and mentoring
for students.
