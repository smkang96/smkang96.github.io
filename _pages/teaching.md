## Giving Lectures

While Ph.D. students usually don't teach students in Korea,
I was able to substitute for my PI on short notice
while he was away due to health issues.

Specifically, I've given substitute lectures (in English) on:

 * Testing for deep neural networks
 * Intellectual Property
 * Anonymity and Security on Computing

## Teaching Assistant

I've participated as a teaching assistant in multiple courses, and
received an Excellent Teaching Assistant Award. As part of my
experience as a TA, I have experience with designing assignments and mentoring
for students.

## Supervising Research

I have experience on conducting research with undergraduate
students (specifically, in my [ISSTA'23 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13773) and [ICST'24 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13229)). I find working with other students to do good research one of the more rewarding parts of being in academia.
